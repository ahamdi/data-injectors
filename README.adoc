= *eXo data-injectors*

A *data injectors* for eXo that allows administrators to inject content types
 such as: social (users, connections, spaces, membership),forum (post, topic), wiki (wiki page), ecms (pdf, doc, xls,... document), FAQ(category,questions,answers..)

== Installation
 * Start by downloading eXo Platform 4.4 and install the add-on :

 cd <PLF_ROOT_DIR>
 ./addon install exo-data-injectors

== How to inject

All the injection commands were designed to be invoked via rest service.
The service is named "org.exoplatform.services.bench.DataInjectorService"
and registered normally to portal container as general component.

The format of request link is:

 http://{domain}/{rest}/private/bench/{inject\|reject}/{type}?\[params\]

So, simply:

1: login to the PLF first

2: call rest services
